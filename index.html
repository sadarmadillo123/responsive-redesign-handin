          <p>
            The goal of this project was to resdesign a simple website with an emphasis on
            making the resdesigned page responsive for different screen sizes. The
            workflow consisted of identifying usability problems, generating wireframes
            and prototypes at different screen sizes to address those issues, and finally
            creating the actual responsive webpage using HTML and CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website I chose to examine was the 'Cupcakes' page for Toronto Cupcakes, a
            bakery based in Toronto, Ontario that specializes in selling various kinds of
            cupcakes. I chose the webpage because I was drawn to the product, but felt the
            site was difficult to use and had a lackluster presentation overall.

              The website design makes shopping a tedious process. Each individual product
              has an associated <b>"Add to Cart"</b> button, but multiple items cannot be
              added to the cart at the same time without leaving the shopping page. As
              shown below, clicking any of the individual <b>"Add to Cart"</b> buttons
              makes the user navigate away from the shopping page to the cart page, where
              the selected price and quantity is shown only for
              <b><u>that specific item</u></b
              >.

                  Fig 2) This figure shows how anytime you add to cart, it takes you
                  directly to the cart page. This behavior is acceptable for smaller
                  orders, but for orders with multiple types of cupcakes it can be quite
                  annoying to navigate back and forth for each type of item.

              There are also clear formatting issues on various screen sizes. The website
              is not responsive, which makes it even more difficult to use for mobile
              users.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The cupcakes in the shop are often misaligned in various ways, which
                  could lead to users think there are missing entries and overall
                  contributes to visual clutter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Additionally, there are buttons that take you to top of the page, but
                  they also have inconsistent formatting. On smaller screens, there are an
                  unncessary amount of these icons.

              The visual hierarchy between different elements/sections in the webpage is
              also unclear at times due to similarities in the header font style and size.

            <li>
              The website consistently displays images for each cupcake, but less
              attention is given to displaying the price or availability of each cupcake,
              particularly for seasonal/holiday cupcakes. Prices are often shown at the
              top of each section, but the pricing of cupcakes can get confusing when
              cupcakes belonging to the same section have different prices.

        <h3>Part 2 Visual Redesign:</h3>
        <div class="section-row-flush-left">
          <p>
            To start the redesign process I began created lo-fi wireframes targeted
            towards addressing the 4 main usability issues discussed above. The annotated
            yellow numbers <b>1-4</b> highlight changes to the layout that address the
            associated usability concerns (above).
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4><i>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</i></h4>

          <img class="zoom-img" src="assets/lofi-tablet.PNG" height="550px" />
          <img class="zoom-img" src="assets/lofi-phone.PNG" height="550px" />
        </div>

        <div class="section-row-flush-left">
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Shopping for Multiple Items</h4>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.2rem">
                To address the usability issues relating to the shopping experience, I
                redesigned the previous "add to cart" functionality. Instead of forcing
                the user to navigate to the shopping cart for each cupcake, I instead make
                it so that adding an element to cart the cart reflects in the shopping
                cart (located in the top right corner of each screen).
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to add an item to cart, the user first clicks on an item that
                interests them which displays a corresponding pop-up. The user can then
                select the quantity of that item to add to cart
                <b>without leaving the screen</b>. Closing the pop-up will allow the user
                to continue browsing and later checkout all items at once. There would be
                also be a red-bubble by the shopping cart that would count the number of
                items in the cart as users make updates.
              </p>
              <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-top: 1rem">
                <img class="zoom-img-large" src="assets/lofi-popup.PNG" />
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Layout and Responsiveness</h4>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.2rem">
                To address responsiveness issues, I highlighted the grid-like layout of
                store elements at different screen sizes. Items in the store should not be
                misaligned or appear to be missing at various screen sizes, as mentioned
                previously.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, also note that the <b>"back to top"</b> icon is only
                included at the end of every section rather than being placed next to each
                cupcake.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Visual Hierarchy</h4>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.2rem">
                To address visual hiearchy, I established clear sections with whitespace
                between each to demarcate each type of cupcake. This prevents issues
                mentioned before where similarly styled headers are placed directly next
                to each other in the document. Each type of cupcake is in its own
                rectangular section, which clearly separates the different types of
                cupcakes from each other as well.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Pricing Information</h4>
              I made an effort to make pricing information available to the customer
              wherever possible. This means pricing information is present for each store
              item, and additionally when each item is clicked and the associated pop-up
              is displayed. When elements are added to the cart, the cart total should be
              shown along with the additional cost of adding the selected item (before the
              user chooses to do so).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h4><i>Visual Design Style Guide:</i></h4>

        <div style="margin-top: 0.8rem; display: flex; justify-content: center">

          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4><i>Hi-Fi Prototyping:</i></h4>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <img
          class="zoom-img-large"
          src="assets/hifi-browser.PNG"
          style="margin-top: 3rem"
        />
        <img
          class="zoom-img-large"
          src="assets/hifi-tablet.PNG"
          style="margin-top: 3rem"
        />
        <img
          class="zoom-img-large"
          src="assets/hifi-phone.PNG"
          style="margin-top: 3rem"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Overall the hi-fi prototypes rely primarily on flexboxes for responsiveness at
        different screen sizes, with the interaction between store sections and store
        items being the most critical. Looking at the desktop hi-fi, you see how store
        items are created with a flex-basis: 1 1 0%. This ensures that all of the
        store-items in the store-container flex-box have consistent sizing. Additionally,
        the store-container flex-box has a wrapping property and even spacing along each
        row, so when three items can no longer fit on the page, the container naturally
        shrinks to holding two or even one items in the case with the phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of the other changes are primarily quality of life changes, with additional
        hover states and tricks like using @media queries to show a different number of
        cupcake logos depending on the screen size.
